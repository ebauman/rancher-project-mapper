The Rancher project mapper webhook should now be installed.

** It is expected that the Deployment pod is in a CrashLoopBackOff. You will need to create a ConfigMap in the
cattle-system namespace with the name `rancher-project-mapper`, and add your mapping rules. Here is an example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
    name: rancher-project-mapper
namespace: cattle-system
data:
    config: |-
        {
            "rules": [
                {
                    "regex": "namespace(s)?",
                    "cluster": "c-12345",
                    "project": "p-12345"
                }
            ]
        }


Once you have created this ConfigMap (** and anytime you make changes **), redeploy the deployment. This can be
accomplished via Rancher, or by simply deleting the pod and letting the Deployment controller recreate it.
